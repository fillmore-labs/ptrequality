/*
ptrequality is a Go linter (static analysis tool) that detects comparisons against
the address of newly created values, such as ptr == &MyStruct{} or ptr == new(MyStruct).
These comparisons are almost always incorrect, as each expression creates a unique
allocation at runtime, usually yielding false or undefined results.

Usage:

	ptrequality [flags] [package ...]

The flags are:

	-c int
		display offending line with this many lines of context (default -1)
	-V
		print version and exit

# Examples

To check the current package:

	ptrequality .

To check all packages in the current module:

	ptrequality ./...

Example of code flagged by ptrequality:

	err := json.Unmarshal(msg, &es)
	if errors.Is(err, &json.UnmarshalTypeError{}) { // flagged
		//...
	}
